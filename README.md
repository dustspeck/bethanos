## About

BeThanos gives you a chance to be Thanos and experience how hard it would have been for Thanos to choose different stones for different avengers and use them accordingly.
In the game, you get to fight each avenger from Hawkeye (level 1) to Iron Man (level 10) one by one in every stage. When you defeat each Avenger, you unlock a new stone in your gauntlet. Each Avenger attacks differently according to their special powers shown in the movies.

## How to Play
You, being Thanos, can move left-right and shoot beams from the gauntlet. Plus, you have to choose which stone you would like to use at the same time.
Difficulty level increases exponentially.
